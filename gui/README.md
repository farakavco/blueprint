## Main Keywords

### What is Graphic Design?

Graphic design is the art of visual communication through the use of images, words, and ideas to give information to the viewers. Graphic design can be used for advertising, or just for entertainment intended for the mind. it can also be defined as a medium through which information is passed through text, sense, animations etc.

### Alignment

Alignment is the act of keeping design objects in line, not only vertically or horizontally but across any linear plane. Alignment also be done respectively, i.e one design element is positioned with respect a another element within same frame.

### Balance

Designs in balance (or equilibrium) have their parts arrangement planned, keeping a coherent visual pattern (color, shape, space). "Balance" is a concept based on human perception and the complex nature of the human senses of weight and proportion. Humans can evaluate these visual elements in several situations to find a sense of balance. A design composition does not have to be symmetrical or linear to be considered balanced, the balance is global to all elements even the absence of content. In this context perfectly symmetrical and linear compositions are not necessarily balanced and so asymmetrical or radial distributions of text and graphic elements can achieve balance in a composition.

### Contrast

Distinguishing by comparing/creating differences. Some ways of creating contrast among elements in the design include using contrasting colors, sizes, shapes, locations, or relationships. For text, contrast is achieved by mixing serif and sans-serif on the page, by using very different type styles, or by using type in surprising or unusual ways. Another way to describe contrast, is to say "a small object next to a large object will look smaller". As contrast in size diminishes, monotony is approached.

### Emphasis

Making a specific element stand out or draw attention to the eye. Emphasis can be achieved in graphic design by placing elements on the page in positions where the eye is naturally drawn, by using other principles such as contrast, repetition, or movement. Bold and italic type provides emphasis for text. Graphic elements gain emphasis through size, visual weight, color, complexity, uniqueness, placement on the page, and other features.

### Gestalt

Sometimes considered a distinct principle of design, gestalt is the concept that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts." Gestalt is a concept from psychology, where theorists note the propensity of humans to conceptually group things together to make a meaningful whole. When viewing designs, humans apply this principle unconsciously by seeing connections and relationships among and between the elements in the design. The overall perception of gestalt in a design is created through harmony, unity, balance, proportion, proximity, and other visual cues. Designers can use this principle to create visual connections and relationships that clarify and strengthen the overall "feel" and meaning of the design.

### Harmony

As with music, graphical elements can be said to be working in harmony - the individual parts come together as visually compelling and a meaningful whole. Disharmony can also be used just as it is in musical compositions: to enhance the emotional complexity, to challenge the viewer, and to give a contrast within the overall composition.

### Movement

Movement is creating an instability, making motion to blur the image. Movement can be achieved by using graphic elements that direct the eye in a certain direction such as arrows that point the way overtly or a series of lines or dots that get progressively larger or smaller, creating a more subtle sense of movement. Movement can be accomplished simply by using a photograph or clip art of something moving - a runner - as opposed to something stationary - a person standing.

### Proportion

This indicates the relative visual size and weight of particular graphical elements in a design composition.

### Proximity

Closeness or distance of individual design elements. Close proximity indicates a connection.

### Repetition

Repeating a sequence; having it occur more than a few times. In design, repetition creates visual consistency in page designs, such as using the same style of headlines, the same style of initial capitals, or repeating the same basic layout from one page to another.
Excessive repetition (monotony) may lead to boredom and uninteresting compositions. If one cannot avoid excessive repetitions for any reason, do not forget to add some visual breaks and white spaces where eyes can rest for a while.

### Rhythm

A strong, regular, repeated pattern of movement or sound. Successful designs have an effective ebb and flow. Text and Graphics should seem to be paced and patterned. Spacing is an effective application of this principle. Second, human beings are more comfortable with variation in general. Psychologically, most any serious lack in variation of anything (a solid, a line, a sound, a situation) can become very boring. Adding a little variation at non-specific intervals (every now and again) gives most any design an interesting appeal as long as it is not overdone.
In setting type, rhythm can be created or disrupted. Compare the gibberish strings, "as erav mono ewone zenao oro remuna oravanam" and "githol urtym reislyt quadirit". Notice how the latter seems to be more organic and readable than the former. This is resultant of two things. One, the eye more easily follows abnormalities and variation, like an ocular foothold. Too-narrow columns result in over-hyphenation. Images that interrupt a passage of text can break the rhythm for the reader and they could disturb the visual appearance of the page. The definition of rhythm is- the suggestion of motion through the use of various elements.

### Unity

Unity creates a feeling of wholeness. Unity is usually achieved when the parts complement each other in a way where they have something in common. Unity can be achieved by use of the same color, or different tints of it, or using a similar graphic style for illustrations.

### White Space

Areas of a design devoid of text or graphics. White space includes margins, gutters, space between lines of type (leading), off-set of text from images (text wraps) and any other part of the page that is empty. White space is also analogous to "negative space" where "positive space" is defined as images, blocks of text, and other graphical elements. In graphic design, the white space, or negative space, is considered an important element of the overall design. It is used - and evaluated - based on the same criteria as the rest of the elements in the design. White space can add to or detract from the balance, unity, harmony, rhythm, and overall success of a design. White space can give emphasis, contrast, and movement. It can be used for repetition and pattern, and work within various relationships with other elements of the positive and negative spaces in the design.


## General principles

Generally accepted principles for Graphical user interface design are:

### 1. Aesthetically pleasing Provide visual appeal by following these presentation and graphic design principles:

 * Provide meaningful contrast between screen elements.
 * Create groupings.
 * Align screen elements and groups.
 * Provide three dimensional representation
 * Use colors and graphics effectively and simply.

### 2. Clarity The interface should be visually, conceptually and linguistically clear, including

 * Visual elements
 * Functions
 * Metaphors
 * Words and text

### 3. Compatibility Provide compatibility with the following:

 * The user
 * The task and job
 * The product
 * Adopt the user’s perspective

### 4. Comprehensibility A system should be easily understood and learned. A user should know the following

 * What to do
 * What to look at
 * When to do it
 * Where to do it
 * Why to do it
 * How to do it
 * The flow of actions, responses, visual preparations and information should be in a sensible order that is easy to recollect and place in context.

### 5. Configurability Permit easy personalization, configuration and reconfiguration of settings.

 * Enhances a sense of control
 * Encourages an active role in understanding

### 6. Consistency A system should look, act, and operate the same throughput. Similar components should:

 * Have a similar look
 * Have similar uses.
 * Operate similarly
 * The same action should always yield the same result.
 * The function of the elements should not change
 * The position of standard elements should not change.

### 7. Control The user must control the interaction.

 * Actions should result from explicit user requests
 * Actions should be performed quickly
 * Actions should be capable of interruption or termination
 * The user should never be interrupted for errors
 * The context maintained must be from the perspective of the user.
 * The means to achieve goals should be flexible and compatible with the user’s skills, experiences, habits and preferences.
 * Avoid modes since they constrain the actions available to the user.
 * Permit the user to customize aspects of the interface, while always providing a proper set of defaults.

### 8. Directness Provide direct ways to accomplish tasks

 * Available alternatives should be visible,
 * The effect of actions on objects should be visible.

### 9. Efficiency

 * Minimize eye and hand movements, and other control actions.
 * Transitions between various system controls should flow easily and freely.
 * Navigation paths should be as short as possible.
 * Eye movement through a screen should be obvious and sequential.
 * Anticipate the user’s wants and needs whenever possible.

### 10. Familiarity Employ familiar concepts and use a language that is familiar to the user.

 * Keep the interface natural, mimicking the user’s behavior patterns.
 * Use real world metaphors.

### 11. Flexibility A system must be flexible to the different needs of its users, enabling a level and type of performance based upon:

 * Each user’s knowledge and skills.
 * Each user’s experience.
 * Each user’s personal preference
 * Each user’s habits
 * The conditions at that moment

### 12. Forgiveness

 * Tolerate and forgive common and unavoidable human errors
 * Prevent errors from occurring whenever possible.
 * Protect against possible catastrophic errors.
 * When an error does occur, provide constructive messages.

### 13. Predictability The user’s should be able to anticipate the natural progression of the task.

 * Provide distinct and recognizable screen elements
 * Provide cues to the result of an action to be performed
 * All expectations should be fulfilled uniformly and completely.

### 14. Recovery A system should permit:

 * Commands or actions to be abolished or reversed.
 * Immediate return to a certain point if difficulties arise.
 * Ensure that users never lose their work as a result of

 * An error on their part
 * H/W, S/W or communication problems.

### 15. Responsiveness The system must rapidly respond to the user’s requests.

 * Provide immediate acknowledgement for all user actions
 * Visual
 * Textual
 * Auditory

### 16. Simplicity

 * Provide as simple an interface as possible
 * Provide defaults
 * Minimize screen alignment points.
 * Make common actions simple at the expense of uncommon actions being made harder.
 * Provide uniformity and consistency
 * Five ways to provide simplicity:
     * Present common and necessary functions first.
     * Prominently feature important functions,
     * Hide more sophisticated and less frequently used functions

### 17. Transparency

 * Permit the user to focus on the task or job, without concern for the mechanics of the interface.
 * Workings and reminders of workings inside the computer should be invisible to the user.

### 18. Trade-offs

 * Final design will be based on a series of trade-offs balancing often-conflicting design principles
 * People’s requirements always take precedence over technical requirements
